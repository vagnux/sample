See COPYING in the same dir as this file


2. Installation
---------------

You need docker and docker compose

docker-compose build
docker-compose --compatibility up -d

This will start, listening on port 1234, serving shuffled files.


3. Options
----------

Edit docker-compose.ym on line bellow alter to folter with your mp3 files

	- /path/you/mp3/files:/media/


4. Notes
--------

This a fork of project https://ample.sourceforge.net/

Added MariaDB support for in future generate playlists

For security reasons it doesn't follow symlinks and only files ending
in .mp3 will be sent (so don't rename any funny files to something.mp3).


5. Bugs
-------

Quite a few probably, too radical changes right now.
